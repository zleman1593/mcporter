# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- CLI ergonomics received a major polish: `mcporter list` now streams spinner updates, renders TypeScript-style signatures (shared with generated CLIs), and prints inline call examples. Command inference auto-detects `list`/`call`/`auth`, the new function-call parser supports unlabeled positional arguments, and colon-delimited flags (`key:value`) are accepted alongside `key=value`.
- Ad-hoc workflows are safer—`--http-url` / bare URLs auto-register temporary servers, but we now reuse existing definitions (and their OAuth tokens/redirect URIs) when the URL matches a configured entry such as Vercel. `mcporter auth <url>` piggybacks on the same logic, writes persisted entries, and retries once if a server flips into OAuth mode mid-flight.
- OAuth detection was hardened: ad-hoc HTTP servers that return 401/403 are automatically promoted to `auth: "oauth"`, and we broadened the unauthorized heuristic so Supabase/Vercel/GitHub style responses trigger the retry. Known provider limitations (Supabase scope lock-down, GitHub/Vercel dynamic registration) are documented in `docs/known-issues.md` and `docs/supabase-auth-issue.md`.
- Added `docs/tool-calling.md` and refreshed README/spec sections so every call style (flags, function expressions, shorthand) is documented, plus new unit tests that mirror the CLI behavior.

- Swapped the `--required-only` / `--include-optional` pair for a single `--all-parameters` flag, updated the CLI hinting copy, and documented the new workflow across README/spec/call-syntax.
- Refined single-server output: doc blocks insert a blank line before `@param`, long sentences wrap to 100 characters, the server summary line prints after the tool details, and color tinting now keeps `function` keywords grey while parameter labels highlight the `@param` and name.
- `Examples:` now shows a single, ellipsized `mcporter call …` entry (unless the call already fits in ~80 characters) so verbose argument lists don't dominate the output.
- Reused the new formatter inside `mcporter generate-cli`, so command summaries (and help) display the same TypeScript-style signatures you see in `mcporter list`.
- Guaranteed that default listings always show at least five parameters (even if every field is optional) before summarising the rest, and added compact summaries (`// optional (N): …`).
- Added `src/cli/list-detail-helpers.ts` plus dedicated unit tests (`tests/list-detail-helpers.test.ts`) covering wrapping, param selection, and optional summaries; introduced an inline snapshot test for a complex Linear server to prevent regressions in the CLI formatter.
- Exported the identifier normalization helpers so other modules can reuse the shared Levenshtein logic without duplicate implementations.
- Added a shared `extractEphemeralServerFlags` helper so `list`, `call`, and `auth` parse ad-hoc transports consistently, extended `mcporter auth` to accept bare URLs/`--http-url`/`--stdio`, and taught single-server listings to hint `mcporter auth https://…` when a 401 occurs. Docs (`README.md`, `docs/adhoc.md`, `docs/local.md`, `docs/call-heuristic.md`) and new tests (`tests/cli-auth.test.ts`, `tests/cli-ephemeral-flags.test.ts`, expanded `tests/cli-list.test.ts`) cover the workflow.
- Flag-style tool invocations now accept `key:value` and `key: value` alongside the existing `key=value` form, making commands like `mcporter context7.resolve-library-id libraryName:value` Just Work. Documented in the README/call syntax guide and covered by `tests/cli-call.test.ts`.
- Added `docs/tool-calling.md`, a cheatsheet summarizing every supported invocation pattern (inferred verbs, flag styles, function-call syntax, and ad-hoc URL workflows).
- Function-call syntax now allows unlabeled arguments; mcporter maps them to schema order after any explicitly named parameters (e.g. `mcporter 'context7.resolve-library-id("react")'`). Tests in `tests/cli-call.test.ts` cover the positional fallback.
- Ad-hoc HTTP servers that respond with 401/403 are automatically promoted to OAuth mode (no manual config edits needed) and trigger the browser sign-in flow on the next attempt. The helper is covered in `tests/runtime-oauth-detection.test.ts`, and the workflow is documented in `README.md` / `docs/adhoc.md` / `docs/spec.md`.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-06

- Added configurable log levels (`--log-level` flag and `MCPORTER_LOG_LEVEL`) with a default of `warn`, and promoted transport fallbacks to warnings so important failures still surface at the quieter default.
- Forced the CLI to exit cleanly after shutdown (new `MCPORTER_NO_FORCE_EXIT` opt-out) and patched `StdioClientTransport` locally so stdio MCP servers do not leave Node handles hanging. Documented the tmux workflow for hang debugging.
- Reworked `mcporter list` output: the spinner no longer gets clobbered, summaries print once discovery completes, and stdio server stderr is buffered (surface via `MCPORTER_STDIO_LOGS=1` or on non-zero exits). Single-server listings now show TypeScript-style signatures, return hints, and inline examples that match the new function-style call syntax.
- Added ad-hoc server support across `mcporter list`/`call`: point at any `--http-url` or `--stdio` command (plus `--env`, `--cwd`, `--name`, `--persist`) without touching config, and persist the generated definition when desired. Documented the workflow in `docs/adhoc.md`.
- Upgraded `mcporter call` with JavaScript-like call expressions (`mcporter call 'linear.create_issue(title: "Bug", team: "ENG")'`) and an auto-correction heuristic that retries obvious typos or suggests the closest tool when confidence is low. The behaviour is covered in `docs/call-syntax.md` and `docs/call-heuristic.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-06

- Added non-blocking `mcporter list` output with per-server status and parallel discovery.
- Introduced `mcporter auth <server>` helper (and library API support) so OAuth flows don’t hang list calls.
- Set the default list timeout to 30 s (configurable via `MCPORTER_LIST_TIMEOUT`).
- Tuned runtime connection handling to avoid launching OAuth flows when auto-authorization is disabled and to reuse cached clients safely.
- Added `mcporter auth <server> --reset` to wipe cached credentials before rerunning OAuth.
- `mcporter list` now prints `[source: …]` (and `Source:` in single-server mode) for servers imported from other configs so you can see whether an entry came from Cursor, Claude, etc.
- Added a `--timeout <ms>` flag to `mcporter list` to override the per-server discovery timeout without touching environment variables.

- Generated CLIs now show full command signatures in help and support `--compile` without leaving template/bundle intermediates.
- StdIO-backed MCP servers now receive resolved environment overrides, so API keys flow through to launched processes like `obsidian-mcp-server`.
- Hardened the CLI generator to surface enum defaults/metadata and added regression tests around the new helper utilities.
- Generated artifacts now emit `<artifact>.metadata.json` files plus `mcporter inspect-cli` / `mcporter regenerate-cli` workflows (with `--dry-run` and overrides) so binaries can be refreshed after upgrading mcporter.
- Fixed `mcporter call <server> <tool>` so the second positional is treated as the tool name instead of triggering the "Argument must be key=value" error, accepted `tool=`/`command=` selectors now play nicely with additional key=value payloads, and added a default call timeout (configurable via `MCPORTER_CALL_TIMEOUT` or `--timeout`) that tears down the MCP transport—clearing internal timers and ignoring blank env overrides—so long-running or completed tools can’t leave the CLI hanging open.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release.
